There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality. -Pablo Picasso

“don’t be like so many writers,
don’t be like so many thousands of
people who call themselves writers,
don’t be dull and boring and
pretentious, don’t be consumed with self-
love.
the libraries of the world have
yawned themselves to
sleep
over your kind.
don’t add to that.
don’t do it.” 
― Charles Bukowski, Sifting Through the Madness for the Word, the Line, the Way
